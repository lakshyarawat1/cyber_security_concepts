# Vulnerability

## Introduction

- A vulnerability is a weakness in a system that allows an attacker to violate the integrity of that system.
- Vulnerabilities are often the result of poor programming practices, poor system configuration, or a lack of security awareness on the part of the user.
- Vulnerabilities can be exploited by an attacker to gain access to a system or to cause a denial of service (DoS).

## Common reasons for vulnerabilities

- Hardware or software misconfigurations.
- Insecure or poor design of the network and application.
- Inherent technology weakness.
- Careless approach of end users.

## Vulnerability Classification

- Misconfiguration
- Default configuration
- Buffer overflow
- Unpatched servers
- Design flaws
- Operating System flaws
- Application flaws
- Open services
- Default passwords 
- Zero-day / Legacy platform Vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Assessment

- A vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing (or ranking) the vulnerabilities in a system.

- It includes in-depth evaluation of the system to identify the vulnerabilities and threats including current security procedures and controls, to withstand the exploitation

### Information obtained from Vulnerability Assessment

- Operating system running on the computers and devices
- Open ports and running services
- Application and services vulnerabilities
- Application and services configuration error
- Account with weak passwords
- Missing patches and hotfixes

### Approaches for Vulnerability Scanning

- Active scans
- Passive scans

### Vulnerability Scoring systems and databases

- An open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of the IT vulnerabilities.
- Its quantitative measure ensures repeatable accurate measurement, while enabling users to view the underlying vulnerability characteristics that were used to generate the scores.

- Some of them are  :

    - Common Vulnerability and exposure (CVE)

    - National Vulnerability Database (NVD) : It is the U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). 

    - Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) : It is a community-developed list of software and hardware weakness types.

### Types of Vulnerability Assessment

- Active assessment
 
    - Uses a network scanner to find hosts, services and vulnerabilities.
    
- External assessment

    - It is performed from outside the network perimeter.
    - It is used to identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited as a perspective of an external attacker.

- Host-based assessment

    - conducts a configuration level check to identify system configurations 

- Application assessment

    - It is used to identify vulnerabilities in web applications.

- Passive assessment

    - It is used to identify vulnerabilities without sending any packets to the target system.
    - Used to sniff network traffic to discover hosts, services and vulnerabilities.

- Internal assessment

    - It is performed from inside the network perimeter.

- Network based assessment

    - It is used to identify vulnerabilities in network devices such as routers, switches and firewalls.

- Database assessment

    - It is used to identify vulnerabilities in database servers.

- Wireless assessment

    - It is used to identify vulnerabilities in wireless networks.

- Distributed assessment

    - Assesses the distributed organization assets and simultaneously identifies vulnerabilities.

- Credentailed assessment

    - Assesses the network by obtaining all the credentials of the target system.

- Non-credentailed assessment

    - Assesses the network without obtaining any credentials of the target system.

- Manual assessment

    - It is used to identify vulnerabilities that cannot be identified by automated tools.

- Automated assessment

    - It is used to identify vulnerabilities using automated tools.

### Vulnerability Management Life Cycle

- Vulnerability management life cycle is a continuous process of identifying, classifying, remediating and mitigating vulnerabilities.
- Its steps are :

    - Identify the assets and resources to be protected.
    - Scan for vulnerabilities.
    - Assess the risk.
    - Remediate the vulnerabilities.
    - Verification
    - Monitor and report.


### Vulnerability research

- The process of analyzing protocols, services and configurations to identify vulnerabilities and design flaws.

- Vulnerabilities are classified based on severity level and exploit range.

### Need for vulnerablity assessment

- To gather information concerning security trends, threats, attack surfaces and attack vectors.
- To discover weaknesses in the OS and applications 
- To know how to recover from the network attacks.

### Vulnerability Exploitation

- Vulnerability Exploitation involves the execution of multiple complex, interrelated steps to gain access to a remote system
- The steps involved are :

    - Identify the vulnerability
    - Determine the risk associated with the vulnerability
    - Determine the capacity of the vulnerability
    - Develop the exploit
    - Select the method of delivering - local or remote
    - Generate and deliver the payload
    - Gain remote access.
