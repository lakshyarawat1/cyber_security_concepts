## Malware

### Types of malware 

Some of the common types of malware are : 

- __Trojans__ : Trojans are malicious programs that looks innocent and harmless but possess harmful code.
    - Trojans gets activated when the user performs some predefined activity.
    - Trojans create a covert communication channel between the victim computer and the attacker.

    - Some indicators of trojan attacks are :

        - To delete or replace critical OS files.
        - Record screenshots, audio, or video of the victim PC
        - Use victim's PC for spammming and blasting messages.
        - Download spyware, adware or any malicious code.

- Downloader : A type of trojan that downloads other malware from the internet to the PC.

- Dropper : A type of trojan that covertly installs other malware files on the system.

- Exploit : A malicious code that breaches the system security via software vulnerabilities to access the information or install malware.

- Injector : A program that injects its code into other vulnerable running processes and changes how they execute to hide or prevent its removal.

- Obfuscator : A program that conceals its code and intended purpose via various techniques, and thus, makes it hard for security mechanisms to detect or remove it.

- Packer : A program that allows all files to bundle together into a single executable file via compression to bypass.

- Payload : A piece of software that allows control over a computer system after it has been explioted.
