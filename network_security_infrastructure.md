## On premise Data Centres

- When it comes to data centers, there are two options : Organization can outsource the data center or own their data center.

- If the data center is owned , it is likely that is on primise.
- A place, like a building for a data center is needed, along with power, HVAC, fire suppression and redundency.

### Redundency

- Designing a system with duplicate components so that if a failure were to occur, there would be backup.
- If redundency is to be implemented, devices should have two power supplies connected to diverse power sources.
-These power sources should have backup with batteries and generators.

### Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)/Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) 

- Some organizations seeking to minimize downtime and enhance BC (Business Continuity) and DR (Disaster Recovery) capabilities will create agreements with other, similar organizations

- They agree that if one of the parties experiences an emergency and cannot operate within their own facility, the other party will share its resources and let them operate within theirs in order to maintain critical functions.

- The difference between an MOA or MOU  and an SLA is that a Memorandum of Understanding is more directly related to what can be done with a system or the information. 

- The service level agreement goes down to the granular level

## Network Design 

- The objective of network design is to satisfy data communication requirements and result in efficient overall performance.

### Network Segregation

- Network segmentation involves controlling traffic among networked devices. 
-  Complete or physical network segmentation occurs when a network is isolated from all outside communications, so transactions can only occur between devices within the segmented network.

### Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)

- A DMZ is a network area that is designed to be accessed by outside visitors but is still isolated from the private network of the organization. 

- The DMZ is often the host of public web, email, file and other resource servers.

### VLAN

- VLANs are created by switches to logically segment a network without altering its physical topology.

### VPN

- A virtual private network (VPN) is a communication tunnel that provides point-to-point transmission of both authentication and data traffic over an untrusted network.

### Network Access Control

Network access control (NAC) is a concept of controlling access to an environment through strict adherence to and implementation of security policy.
