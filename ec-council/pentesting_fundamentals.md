# Penetration Testing Fundamentals

## Introduction

- Penetration testing is a type of security testing that evaluates an organization's ability to protect its infrastructure such as network, applications, systems and users against external as well as internal threats

- The main purpose of penetration testing is to identify security weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the system and to determine whether unauthorized access or other malicious activity is possible

- It is an effective way of determining the efficiency of the organizations' security policies and procedures

- It involves the active evaluation of the security of the organization's infrastructure by simulating an attack similar to an attack from a malicious source


### Benefits of conducting a Penetration Test

- Reveal vulnerabilities
- Show real risks
- Ensure business continuity
- Reducing client-end attacks
- Establishing the status of the company in terms of security
- Guard the reputation of the company


## Comparing Security Audit, Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing


### Security Audit

- A security audit checks whether an organization follows a set of standard security policies and procedures

- It is a systematic evaluation of the security of a company's information system by measuring how well it conforms to a set of established criteria


### Vulnerability Assessment

- A vulnerability assessment focuses on discovering the vulnerabilities in the information system but provides no indication of whether the vulnerabilities can be exploited or not or of the amount of damage that may result after the exploitation of the vulnerability.


- It is a systematic review of security weaknesses in an information system


### Penetration Testing

- A penetration test is a method of evaluating the security of an information system by simulating an attack from a malicious source

- Penetration testing is a methodological approach to security assessment that encompasses a security audit and vulnerability assessment, and it demonstrates whether the vulnerability in the system can be successfully exploited by attackers


## Types of Penetration Testing


- Goal-oriented / Objective oriented Penetration Testing :

    - This type of asssesment is driven by goals. The objectives of the pentesting are defined, rather than defining the scope of the targets

    - The goal of pentesting is defined before it begins

    - The job of pen tester is to check whether he can achieve the goal and determine the different ways to achieve the goal


- Compliance oriented testing :

    - This type of assessment is driven by compliance requirements. It is testing against adherence to compliance requirements

    - It entails conducting an assessment against the compliance requirements of cyber security standards, frameworks, laws, acts etc.

    - For example, an organization may ask to perform a security assessment against PCI-DSS requirements.


- Red-teaming based testing :

    - Red-team based pen testing is an adversarial goal-based  assessment in which the tester must mimic the behavior of a real attacker and target the environment,

    - This assessment has no specific driver

    - For example, an organization may ask to conduct a security assessment for evaluating its overall security. It may include assessing people, networks, applications, physical security etc.


## Strategies for penetration testing

- Black-box testing

    - In black-box testing, the tester has no prior knowledge of the target system

    - The tester is provided with the name of the organization and the scope of the assessment

    - The tester has to perform the assessment as a real attacker would do

    - The tester has to perform the assessment without any prior knowledge of the target system


- White-box testing

    - In white-box testing, the tester has complete knowledge of the target system

    - The tester is provided with the name of the organization and the scope of the assessment

    - The tester is provided with the network diagrams, IP addresses, source code, etc. of the target system

    - The tester has to perform the assessment with complete knowledge of the target system


- Gray-box testing : 

    - In gray-box testing, the tester has partial knowledge of the target system

    - The tester is provided with the name of the organization and the scope of the assessment

    - The tester is provided with partial information about the target system

    - The tester has to perform the assessment with partial knowledge of the target system



## Penetration testing process


### Defining the scope 

- Extent of testing

- What will be tested

- Where the testing will be performed from

- Who will perform testing


### Perform the Peneration Testing

- Involves gathering all information significant to security vulnerabilities

- Involves testing the targeted environment such as network, configuration, applications, etc.


### Reporting and Delivering results

- Listing vulnerabilities

- Categorizing risks as high, medium and low

- Recommending repairs if vulnerabilities are found


## Penetration Testing Methodologies

- Various penetration testing frameworks and methodologies exist to help organizations choose the best method to conduct a successful penetration test


### Most common penetration testing methodologies

- EC-Council's LPT (Licensed Penetration Tester)

- IBM

- ISS

- McAfee Foundstone

- OSSTMM

- NIST

- CREST

- OWASP

- ISSAF


## Characteristics of a Good Peneration Test

- Establishing the parameters of the penertration test such as objectives, limitations, and justifications of procedures

- Hiring skilled and experienced professionals to perform a test

- Choosing a suitable set of tests that balance cost and benefits

- Following the methododoly with proper planning and documentation

- Documenting the result carefully and making it comprehensible for the client


## When a pentest should be performed

Pentesting are generally performed in the following cases :

- Changes have been made in the organization's infrastructure

- A new threat to the organization's infrastructure has been discovered

- Hardware or software has been upgraded or reinstalled

- The organizations' policy has been changed.


## Ethics of a Penetration Tester

- Perform the test only after getting written permission from the client

- Work according to the non-disclosure and liability agreements of the contract

- Test tools in an isolated laboratory environment before using them in the production environment

- Inform the client about any possible risks that might emanate from the tests

- Notify the client at the first discovery of any highly vulnerable flaws

- Deliver social engineering test results only in a summerized and statistical format

- Try to maintain a degree to seperation between the criminal hacker and the security professional


## Evolving as a Penetration tester

- Technologies evolve and change

- Look outside the workplace to expand knowledge

- Attend conferences, workshops and training 

- Join various security groups and discuss current security related topics

- Keep your career alive by constantly updating your knowledge and skill set

- read books, journals and trade magazines

- Visit various security websites and forums

- Visit libraries and bookstores to glean information


## Qualifications / Skills and Certifications for a Penetration Tester

- The tester should possess security certifications like CEH, CPENT, CISSP, OSCP, etc.

- Skills required for a penetration tester include :

    - Networking - TCP / IP concepts and cabling techniques

    - Ethical hacking techniques - exploits, hacking tools, etc.
