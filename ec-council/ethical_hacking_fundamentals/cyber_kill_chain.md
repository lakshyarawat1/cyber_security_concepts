# Cyber Kill Chain

## introduction

The Cyber Kill Chain is a model developed by Lockheed Martin that serves as a framework for describing the stages of a cyberattack from the initial reconnaissance to the exfiltration of data. The model identifies the steps that an adversary must take to complete a successful intrusion and the defensive measures that can be taken to prevent them.

- It has 7 steps:
    - Reconnaissance
    - Weaponization
    - Delivery
    - Exploitation
    - Installation
    - Command and Control
    - Actions on Objectives

- We can use the Cyber Kill Chain to identify the steps that an adversary must take to complete a successful intrusion and the defensive measures that can be taken to prevent them.
- If the chain is broken at any point, the attack fails.
