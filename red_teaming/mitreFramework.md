# Mitro Attck Framework

## Introduction

- Knowledge base for cyber adversary behavior and techniques used in the real world.
- Abbreviation for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge.
- Used as a baseline and model for red teaming engagements.
- Categorizes adversary behavior into tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). 


## Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

- Tactics : Tactical goal or objective of an adversary during an attack.
- Techniques : Actions taken by an adversary to achieve a tactical goal.
- Procedures : All known implementations of a technique or sub-technique.


## Usage

- Provides a common language for red teamers to communicate and share knowledge.
- Helps in planning and executing red teaming engagements.
- Assists in identifying gaps in blue team's defenses and improving their detection and response capabilities.
- Used to simulate real-world adversary behavior and test blue team's response.

## Planning engagement

### Scope and Objectives

- Defining goals can be difficult and tidious
- Consider and depth and nature of the engagement
- Engagements are classified into : 
    - Full Simulation / Extended Penetration Test

    - Adversary Emulation

- Scope is defined by the client and should be agreed upon before starting the engagement.
- Scope defines what you can and cannot do during the engagement.
- Scope will depend upon client infrastructure, resources, and objectives.

### Rules Of Engagement (RoE)

- Responsibility, relationship and guidelines required to conduct the engagement.
- Documentes the target info, approvals, threat implementation, activities and issues required to staff, coordinate and execute engagements
- Outlines the scope and objectives of the engagement.

- Body of the ROE should have :
    - Medthodology used
    - High level description of the type of activities to be performed
    - Type of hardware and software used
    - Recommended deconflicting activities
    - Roles and responsibilities of the team members
    - Identification and references to appropriate legal requirements
    - A legal disclaimer

### Types of Engagement Plannings

- Engagement Plan : Outlines technical requirements of the Red Team ( CONOPS, Resources, Tools, etc. )
- Operations Plan : Detailed version of the engagement plan (Roles and responsibilities, timelines, etc.)
- Mission Plan : Execution Plan(Commands to run, when to execute, responsible operator)
- Remidiation Plan : Next phases, reporting, and remediation steps.
