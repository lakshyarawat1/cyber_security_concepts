## Security mechanism standards

### Encryption

- Process of changing information (plaintext) using an algorithm (cipher) to convert it into a form that is not readable
- One of the earliest encryption applications was called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) in 1991 by Phil Zimmermann.
- Always add a digital signature at the time of creation, so that it prevents the tempering of date in transit

### Cryptography

-
