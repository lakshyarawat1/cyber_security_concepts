# Security Policies and Standards

## Definition

- Constraints on the behavior of its members and constraints imposed on the adversary by mechanics like doors, locks etc.
- In business, security policy documents in writing how a company plans to protect its physical and IT assets.
- It is considered as a 'living' document, i.e. it is never finished, but continuously updated.
- Can be decomposed into sub-policies when required.

## Information Security

- Protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, perusal, inspection, recording or destruction.

## Purpose of a policy

- Protect people and information
- Set the rules for expected behavior by users, systems, admins, management and security personnel,
- Authorize security personnel to monitor, probe and investigate
- Define and authorize the consequences of violation
- Define the computer consensus baseline stance on security.
- Help minimize risks.
- Help track compliance with regulations and guidelines/legislature

## User of Policies

### Audience Groups

- Company employees
- Sub-categories can be :
    - Management - all levels
    - Technical Staff - system admin
    - End Users

## Policy Types

### Hierarchy

- Governing Policy
- Technical Policy
- Guidelines / Job Aids

### Governing Policy

- Should cover infoSec concepts at high level, define concepts, describe their importance, and define company's stand on it.
- Read by Managment and End users.
- Shoule be closely aligned with existing and future HR and other policies.

### Technical Policy

- More detailed and specific than Governing policy
- They describe what must be done, but not how to be done. It should be in Guidelines / Aids

### Job Aids / Guidelines

- States "How" to carry out policy statements
- Need not be made by the policy makers, can be helped with technical staff or person of better knowledge
- Better that individual business unit should develop their own document
- Will also act as a backup facility if a staff member leaves, ensuring their knowledge isn't lost.

## Policy Development Process

### Approach

- Process maturity should be considered
- Start off small, checklist style policy and build up on it
- Consider all threat types
- Give Current Practice vs Preferred Future

### Team 

- InfoSec team : Overall responsibilty of developing a policy.
- Technical writers : Assist
- Technical Personnel : Expertise in individual units, familiarity with day-to-day use.
- Legal Counsel : Should review the policy once completed, for compliance
- HR : To review the alignment with other policies
- Audit and Compliance : Ensures that it is enforceable
- User groups : Gives feedback 

### Development Cycle

- Senior Management Buy In : Confirmation and support for initiation of task
- Determine a Compliance Grace Period :
    - Grace Period allows others to review the new policies.
    - Can be few months to one year
- Determine Resource Involvement : 
    - Identify who you should talk to, to determine and agree on the content of the policy.
- Review Existing Policy : 
    - Collect all related procedures and guidelines as well as high level docs.
    - They can become starting point of new policy
- Determine research material : 
    - Internet (www.securityfocus.com)
    - SANS
    - Journals, books, white papers
- Interview SMEs : 
    - Define objectives
    - Prepare for meeting
    - Control the interview
    - Sum up and confirm
    - Post-interview review
- Write Initial Draft 
- Style considerations : 
    - Consult a coorporate style guide.
    - Consistent style throughout
    - Don't use abstract language, like, regularly, generally etc.
    - Avoid using very negative statements like 'never' instead use strong negatives like 'must not'
    - Simple and easy to understand language.
    - Use 'must' for shall and 'will' for must
    - Don't give and background context in the doc, it will be in the different doc
    - All points should be gramatically similar.
    - Don't include names of any individual, instead use job role.
- Review Cycle  : Review Yourself
- Review with Additional Stakeholders 
- Policy Gap Identification Process :
    - Document any gaps.
    - There should be minimum gaps.
- Develop Communication Strategy : 
    - Make it a contractual requirement
    - Make it part of the training process
    - Use subscription-based communication method
- Publish 
- Activate Communication Strategies
- Regularly review and update

## Standards

- Security standards which enable organizations to practice safe security techniques to minimize no. of successful cyber attacks.

### ISO 27002

- Incorporates both parts of BS 7799 standard
- Part I specifies the outline for cyber security policy
- Part II provides the certification
- Certification obtained once three years and is periodically checked by BSI to ensure compliance
- ISO 27002 is arranged into 11 control areas :
    - Security policy
    - organizing information security
    - asset management and operations
    - access controls
    - information security acquisition/development/maintainance
    - incident handling
    - business continuity
    - management
    - compliance

### Standard of Good Practice (SoGP)

- Published in 1990s, by Information Security Forum (ISF)
- List of best practices for information security
- Updates every two years, latest 2007

### North American Electric Reliability Coorporation (NERC)

- Created many standards
- Widely used is NERC 1300, which is a modification/update of NERC 1200
- Newest version is called CIP-002-1 (Critical Infrastructure protocol)
- Used to secure bulk electric systems although NERC also provides network security admin

### NIST

- Special publication 800-12 provides a broad overview of computer security and control areas.
- Special Publication 800-14 describes common security practices that are used. 
    - Gives high level description of what should be incorporated within a security policy
- Special publication 800-26 provides on how to manage IT security. Emphasizes on importance of self assessment and risk assessments
- Special publication 800-37, updated in 2010, approach is "Guide for Applying Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems"
- Special Publication 800-53 rev3, "Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems"

### Common Criteria (ISO 15408)

- Allows many different software applications to be integrated and tested in a secure way.

### RFC 2196

- Published by Internet Engineering Task Force
- For information systems connected on Internet.
- Provides overview of security of network, incident response or security policy

## ISA-99

### ISO 27001

- Developed by International Organization for Standardization, ISO and IEC
- It is designed to be used in conjunction with ISO 17799:2005
- To achieve the certification, the organization must use the risk based approach specified within ISO 17799:2005
