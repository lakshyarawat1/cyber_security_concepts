# Zero Trust Principle

- Verify explicitly : Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points
- Use least privilege access : Limit user access with Just-in-time and Just-Enough-Access, risk based adaptive policies and data protection.
- Assume breach

- Trust no one-verify everything.
