# Zero Trust Principle

- Verify explicitly : Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points

- Use least privilege access : Limit user access with Just-in-time and Just-Enough-Access, risk based adaptive policies and data protection.
- Assume breach

- Trust no one-verify everything.

- A Zero Trust approach should extend throughout the entire digital estate and serve as an integrated security philisophy.

- This is done by implementing six foundational pillars of Zero Trust :
    - Identity
    - Endpoints
    - Data
    - App
    - Infrastructure
    - Network
