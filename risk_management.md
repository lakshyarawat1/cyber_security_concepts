# Risk Management

- Risk is the measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstances or event.
- It is often expressed as combination of :
    - the adverse impacts that would arise if any event occurs
    - the likelihood of the occurance

- Information security risk reflects the potential adverse impacts that result from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure etc.

## Threats and Vulnerabilities

- A vulnerability is a gap or weakness in an organization's protection of its valuable assets, including information.


- A threat is something or someone that aims at exploiting a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access
- Typical threat actors include the following :
    - Insiders
    - Outside individuals or informal groups
    - Formal entities
    - Political entities
    - Intelligence or information gatherers
    - Technology

- A threat vector is the means by which an actor carries out its objectives.

- An asset is something that needs protection

- Likelihood of occurance is the weighted factor based on subjective analysis of the probability that a given threat or set of threats is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability.

- Impact is the magnitude of harm that can be expected to result from the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of information, or loss of information.

## Risk Assessment

- Rist Assessment is defined as the process of identifying, estimating and priotizing risks to organization's operations, assets, individuals.
- Risk Assessment should result in aligning each identified risk resulting from the operation of an information system with the goals, objective and assets that organisation uses.


## Risk Treatment

- Risk Treatment relates to making decisions about the best actions to take regarding the identified and priotized risk. 
- Decisions are made dependent on the attitude of management towark risk and availiability and cost.


### Risk Acceptance

- Risk acceptance is taking no action to reduce the likelihood of a risk occuring.
- It is done because the impact or likelihood of occurance is negligible.
- Benefits are more that enough to offset the risk.

### Transfer

- Risk Transference is the practice of passing the risk to another party, who will accept the financial impact of the harm resulting from risk.
- Typically this is insurance policy.

### Mitigation

- Risk mitigation is the most common type of risk management and includes taking actions to prevent or reduce the possibility of risk event or its impact.
- Mitigation involves remediation measures, or controls, such as security controls, establishing policies, procedures and standards to minimize adverse risk.
- Risk cannot always be mitigated.

### Avoidance

- Risk avoidance is the decision to attempt to eliminate the risk entirely.
- This includes ceasure of operations for some or all the activities that are exposed to a particular risk.
- Risk avoidance is performed when the impact is too high or if likelihood of the risk is too great.

## Priotizing risk

- After identification, risk priotization is the next step.
- It is done through qualitative risk analysis and quantitative risk analysis.

- This is necessary to determine root cause and narrow down apparent risks and core risks.

- One effective way to risk priotizing is using risk matrix, which helps to identify priority as the intersection of likelihood and impact.
- It also gives the team a common language to use with management when determining the final priorities.

- It has several portions: 
    - High Probability, High Impact
    - High Probability, Low Impact
    - Low Probability, High Impact
    - Low Probability, Low Impact

## Risk Tolerance

- The measure of risk and impact the organization is willing to absorb or expect is called risk tolerance.
- Security professionals aim to maintain the levels of risk within the management's limit of risk tolerance.
