## Business Continuity (BC)

- Business Continuity is a business level of readiness to maintain critical functions after an emergency or disruption. These events include :
    - Security breaches
    - Natural disasters
    - Power outages
    - Equipment Failures
    - Sudden staff departure

### About

- If key business capability fails, then a quick recovery time is crutial.
- A business continuity has three considerations
    - Resiliency
    - Recovery
    - Contingency

### Tools

- Some tools for BC are :

    - Back up : Backing up data is one of the simplest way to ensure BC.
    - Backup as a Service : Similar to backup but a third party service is used to backup data.
    - Point in time and Instant Recovery Copies : Point in time copies or snapshots copy the entire db at regular intervals. Instant recoveryc copies takes snapshots of entire Virtual machine. These copies are stored in off-site or on a virtual machine that is unaffected by the disaster.
    - Cold site : Businesses can set up a basic infrastructure in a second facility known as cold site, where workers can work after any disaster or fire. 
    - Hot site : Similar to cold site, but it also maintains a up-to-date copy of data all the time. More expensive that cold site , but reduces downtime.
    - Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) : DRaaS provider moves and organisation's computers processing to their own cloud infrastructure in a event of disaster. Businesses pay for these through subscription or a pay-per-use model.
    - Physical Tools :  Physical elements that can support business continuity include fire suppression tools to help data and computer equipment survive a fire, and a back-up power source that supports businesses through short-term power outages.
    - Virtualizaton : Virtualization is one of the few ways to back up a working replica of an organizationâ€™s entire computing environment. Businesses can also automate some disaster recovery processes on off-site virtual machines that are unaffected by physical disasters, bringing everything back online faster. Frequent transfer of data and workloads is essential for virtualization to be an effective disaster recovery tool.


## Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery relies upon the replication of data and computer processing in an off-premises location not affected by the disaster.

## Incident Recovery

Incident response (IR) is the effort to quickly identify an attack, minimize its effects, contain damage, and remediate the cause to reduce the risk of future incidents.

### Right plan for IR

- Prepare a team that can handle any type of threat
- Detect and identify the type and severity of the threat once it has occured
- Contain and limit the damage
- Determine its impact and associated risk
- Find and eradicate the root cause
- Mitigate and resolve the attack
- Analyze and modify the plan post-attack to prevent the future ones.
