# CIA triad

- It stands for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability

## Confidentiality

- Relates to permitting authorized access to information, while at the same time protecting information from improper disclosure.

- It is difficult to achieve when there are different types and tiers of users in the system.
- Main aim is to protect the data that needs protection, yet permit authorized users access to it.

- Personally Identifiable information (PII) is a term related to confidentiality.
- It pertains to any data about an individual that could be used to identify them

- Protected Health Information (PHI) refers to any personal health information.
- Classified or Sensitive Information, which includes trade secrets, research, business plans and intellectual property.

- Sensitivity is the measure of importance assigned to information by its owner, or the purpose of denoting its need for protection.


## Integrity

- Integrity is the property of information whereby it is recorded, used and maintained in a way that ensures its completeness, accuracy, internal consistency and usefulness for a stated purpose.

- Integrity measures the degree to which something is whole and complete, internally consistant and correct. 
- The concept of integrity applies to :
    - information or data
    - systems and processes for business operations
    - organisations
    - people and their actions

- Data integrity is the assurance that data is not altered in an unauthorized manner. 
- This requires the protection for the data in systems and during processing to ensure that it is free from improper modifications, errors or loss of information and is recorded, used and maintained in a way that ensures its completeness.
- Is covers data in storage, in processing and in transit.


- Consistency as a part of data integrity, requires that all instances of data be identical in form, content and meaning.

- System integrity refers to the maintainance of a known good configuration and expected operational function as a system processes the information.
- Ensuring integrity starts with state awareness, which is current condition of the system.
- Especially the awareness concerns the ability to document and understand that state of data or a system at a certain point, creating a baseline.

- Integrity of the data or system can always be ascertained by comparing the baseline with the current state.
- If two matches, then the integrity is intact.

## Availability

- Means that systems and data are accessible at the time users need them.

- Defined as timely and reliable access to information and the ability to use it.
