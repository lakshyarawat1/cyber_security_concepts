<!-- OSINT -->

# OSINT

## Introduction

- OSINT stands for Open Source Intelligence.
- It is data collected from publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context.

## The Iceberg Internet Analogy

- The internet is like an iceberg.
- Internet is divided into 3 parts:
  - Surface Web
  - Deep Web
  - Dark Web

### Surface Web

- Typically, the surface web is what we think of when we think of the internet.
- Includes all the websites that can be indexed by search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.
- Surface web is only 4% of the internet.
- Includes websites like:
  - Facebook
  - Twitter
  - Instagram
  - Reddit
  - Wikipedia
  - etc.

### Deep Web

- The deep web is the part of the internet that is not indexed by search engines.
- It is estimated that the deep web is 90% of the internet.
- Deep web is part of the internet that is not accessible by conventional means.
- This web is password protected.
- This includes things like:
  - Private social media accounts
  - Online banking
  - Webmail
  - etc.

### Dark Web

- Dark web is a part of the internet that is intentionally hidden and requires special software to access.
- Dark web is only 6% of the internet.
- Dark web is used for illegal activities.
- It can be accessed using special software like:
  - Tor
  - I2P
  - Freenet
  - etc.

## Types of OSINT

- There are 2 types of OSINT:
  - Offensive OSINT : Used by hackers to gather information about a target.
  - Defensive OSINT : Used by companies to protect themselves from hackers.

## Grey Literature

- Grey literature is information produced by government, academia, business, and industry in electronic and print formats not controlled by commercial publishing i.e. where publishing is not the primary activity of the producing body.
- It is produced by organizations outside of the traditional commercial or academic publishing and distribution channels.

## OSINT Cycle

- OSINT cycle is a process of collecting information about a target.
- The cycle consists of 5 steps:
  - Planning
  - Gathering
  - Analysis
  - Dissemination
  - Feedback

### Planning

- Planning is the first step of the OSINT cycle.
- In this step, we plan how we are going to collect information about the target.
- We also plan what information we are going to collect about the target.
- We also plan what tools we are going to use to collect information about the target.

### Gathering

- Gathering is the second step of the OSINT cycle.
- In this step, we collect information about the target.

### Analysis

- Analysis is the third step of the OSINT cycle.
- In this step, we analyze the information we have collected about the target.
- Validating the information is also a part of this step.

### Dissemination

- Dissemination is the fourth step of the OSINT cycle.
- In this step, we share the information we have collected about the target.
- This includes creating a report about the target.

### Feedback

- Feedback is the fifth step of the OSINT cycle.
- In this step, we get feedback about the information we have collected about the target.

## OSINT Ethics

- Some ethics that we should follow while doing OSINT are:
  - Legality : We should not do anything illegal while doing OSINT.

  - Respect : We should respect the privacy of the target.

  - Accuracy and Verification : We should verify the information we have collected about the target from various sources. Do not spread unverified information.

  - Transparency and Attribution : We should be transparent about the sources from where information we have collected about the target. We should also give credit to the sources from where we have collected the information.

  - Doxing : Doxing is the act of finding one's personal information through research and discovery, with little to no information to start with. You should not dox anyone.
