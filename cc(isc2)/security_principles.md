# Security Principles

## Understanding the concepts of information assurance
- Measures to protect and defend information and info systems by ensuring
    - availability
    - integrity
    - authentication
    - confidentiality
    - non repudiation

- IA is about ensuring that authorized users have access to authorized info at authorized time.
- These measures include providing for restoration of info system by incorporating protection, detection and reaction capabilities.


### Glossary

- Confidentiality : ensures the disclosure of info only to those people with authority to see it.
- Integrity : ensures that info remains in its original state
- Availability : info and info resources is ready for use within stated operational parameters
- Possession : info or resources remains in custody of authorized person
- Authenticity : info or resources conforms to reality, it is not misrepresented as something it is not.
- Utility : info is fit for a purpose or in usable state.
- Privacy : ensures the protection of personal info from observation or intrusion as well as adherence to privacy related complaints
- Authorized use : ensures cost incurring services are available only to authorized users.
- Non repudiation : ensures the originator of a message or transaction may not later deny action

### IA Architecture 

- Risk (root driver) may be expressed in terms of business drivers and technical drivers
- Six architectural views :
    - people
    - policy
    - business process
    - system and application
    - info/data
    - infrastructure

### Information Assurance Process

- Enumeration and classification of info assets ( e.g., data/IT and value)
- Risk assessment ( vulnerability and threat)
- Risk analysis ( probability, and impacts )
- Risk Management ( treatment )
- Test and review
- Repeat

### The security Paradigm

- Trust No One
- Make Would-be intruders believe they will be caught
- Protect in layers
- While planning the security strategy, presume the complete failure of any security layer 
- Disable unneeded services and packages
- Prepare for the worst

## Risk Management

- Risk management is the strategic approach to prioritize threats.
- Risk management strategy acknowledges that organisation cannot entirely eliminate all system vulnerabilities. 
- Establishing a risk management strategy helps organisation attend first the most critical flaws, threats and attacks.

### Risk Identification

- Risk identification enables the organisation to minimize the impact of attacks and threats.
- Objective is to identify all risks that can harm company operations, suck as lawsuits, theft, technology breaches, business downturns or even disasters.
- Risk identification should be continuous and thoughtful.

### Ways to identify risk

- **Brainstorming** : look for all possibilities of various catastrophic events with other company stakeholders.
- **Thinking Pessimitically** : Planning for the worst and expect the best. 
- **Seeking Employees Feedback**

## Security Controls

- Security Controls exists to reduce or mitigate the risk to those assets.
- They include policy, technique, method, solution or device designed to help it.
- for example, firwall, antivirus

### Physical Controls

- Physical controls describe anything tangible that is used to prevent or detect unauthorized access to physical areas, systems or assets.
- These include fences, gates, guards, CCTV or access cards.

### Technical Controls

- aka logical controls
- Technical controls include hardware or software mechanisms used to protect assets.
- like firewalls, antivirus systems, Intrusion detection systems and encryption methods.

### Administrative Controls

- Administrative controls refers to policies, procedures or guidelines that define personnel or business practices in accordance with the organisations security goals.
