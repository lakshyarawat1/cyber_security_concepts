# Access Control Concepts

## Logical Access Control 

A logical access control system requires the validation of an individual's identity through some mechanism, such as a PIN, card, biometric, or other token. It has the capability to assign different access privileges to different individuals depending on their roles and responsibilities in an organization.

## Principle of least privilege

-  the principle of least privilege is a crucial aspect of any security strategy as it helps to minimize the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and other security threats.
-  states that a user or process should only be granted the minimum level of access or permission necessary to perform their tasks or functions. 
- In other words, a user should only have access to the resources and information that they need to do their job and nothing more.
-  By granting the lowest level of access necessary, organizations can limit the damage that can be caused by an attacker who gains access to a user's account.

## Segregation of duties (SoD)

- Segregation of duties is a security principle that involves dividing critical functions and responsibilities among multiple individuals or teams to prevent any one person from having too much control or influence over a particular process.

-  This helps to prevent fraud, errors, and other security risks that may arise from having too much power concentrated in one individual.

## Discretionary access control

Discretionary access control is the principle of restricting access to objects based on the identity of the subject 

## Mandatory access control (MAC)

A means of restricting access to system resources based on the sensitivity (as represented by a label) of the information contained in the system resource and the formal authorization (i.e., clearance) of users to access information of such sensitivity.
